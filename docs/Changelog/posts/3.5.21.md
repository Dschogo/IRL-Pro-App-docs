# 3.5.21

- Important! Codec now defaults to auto for new users, will use H264 for RTMP, HEVC for all others.
- Important! Starting and stopping stream now has a confirm dialog
- Connection wizard create for Twitch and Kick
- Anti-Flicker defaults to auto
- Add ability to toggle stream mirror in Quick Settings
- Add ability to edit the text of a text overlay in Quick Settings
- Option to clear all web overlay and alert overlay cookies (if need to change accounts etc)
- Option to enable geo api for web overlays, so can use things like realtimeirl
- Easier changing of currently active connection (don't have to uncheck first)
- Other misc fixes

Because there was a fairly significant rework of the connection start process, this one will remain alpha for a bit to confirm no issues
